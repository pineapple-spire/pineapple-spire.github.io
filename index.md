## Development History

The development process for Pineapple-Spire adheres to [Issue Driven Project Management](https://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics414s25/modules/project-management/) practices. In summary:

- Development is organized into **Milestones**.
- Each milestone consists of a set of tasks.
- Tasks are described using GitHub Issues and assigned to individual developers.
- Tasks typically involve work that can be completed in **2-4 days**.
- Each task is developed in a separate Git branch named `issue-XX`, where `XX` is the issue number.
- Once a task is complete, its corresponding issue is closed, and the branch is merged into `master`.
- Task statuses (To Do, In Progress, Complete) are managed via a GitHub Project Board.
